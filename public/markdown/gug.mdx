### This is the first post in my endeavor to escape GitHub  

Now, the first question you may be thinking of is "why?". Github provides leading class and ubiquitous tools for creating and sharing anything code related.  
They help anyone with the zeal to learn programming get started and give them the tools to do it.

And the answer is, I Don't Want It. I don't want their help.

For a long time -but especially after being acquired by Microsoft- I've been increasingly thinking about how GitHub, the bastion of open source software, is itself proprietary and <u><a href="https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/" target="_blank">outright against the open source community</a></u>. Developers become trapped in a walled garden of convenience that turns into a canyon you have to fight out of before ever hoping to regain some comfortability and efficiency. At least at first.

I've had plenty of time to get used to the FOSS lifestyle. I installed Linux, switched to tools like VSCodium. And I liked it. At this point, nothing was so daunting as to disrupt my entire workflow, almost everything I've gotten used to in these years of software development. Until I thought "I want to move away from GitHub."  
My first option was Gitlab. They're open source and still easy to use, right? Well, sort of. The ease of use never played out for me and unless you host it yourself, Gitlab is just as proprietary. So what to do?  
I gave up.  
Only for a little while, though. I searched for different options, and while comprobable, nothing stood out to me. Until SourceHut. Although its in early development, the feature set, aesthetics, and goals meet mine well. So well, in fact, that I don't even mind paying the miniscule subscription they charge to host projects there. Especially because I know it goes straight back into development.  

As of now I'm still migrating everything. This is a very "do it yourself your way" kind of tool, but I have high hopes. If you found this at all intersting, consider checking it  (or other GitHub alternatives) out.
