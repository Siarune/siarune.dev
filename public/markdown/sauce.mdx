I got into web development specifically because frankly my school-issued chromebook couldn't handle anything else.  
My websites have come a long way since that Apache server running on a Raspberry Pi.
Not that my design skills have improved, but I like to think this is better.  
This particular version is built Next.js, my React framework of choice. 
It's hosted on Vercel, which is part of my GitHub deployment pipeline.  
There's also a few libraries sprinkled around, like Clerk.js for authentication and at some point Firebase for all those bells and whistles.
